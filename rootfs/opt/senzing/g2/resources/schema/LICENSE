END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
This End User License Agreement and the Third Party Software Components (Appendix A) (collectively, "Senzing 
EULA"), govern the use of the entity resolution and relationship awareness engine in Object Code format that 
accompanies this Senzing EULA and that is owned or licensable by Senzing, Inc. ("Licensor"), including any 
updates that Licensor may choose to provide (collectively, "Licensor Software"), with such use being solely by the 
person or entity ("you" or "your") that has agreed with the terms of this Senzing EULA.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS SENZING EULA, YOU MUST NOT USE THE 
SOFTWARE. YOU HEREBY REPRESENT TO LICENSOR THAT YOU ARE A NATURAL PERSON, YOU ARE 
OVER EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OF AGE, THAT YOU MAY LEGALLY ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AND 
THAT YOU AGREE WITH ALL THE TERMS OF THIS SENZING EULA.

1.	GRANT OF LICENSE.

1.1	Licensor Software Packages. When you enter into this Senzing EULA, you have the opportunity 
to select a particular Licensor Software package (each, a "Licensor Software Package") as 
provided below, subject to the limitations described therein:

A.	Senzing App License; or
B.	Senzing API License.

The term of this Senzing EULA ("Term") shall commence on the date the Licensor Software is 
delivered and shall remain in effect for the subscription period set forth in the corresponding 
Licensor Software Package you selected, subject to earlier termination as set forth in SECTION 5 
("TERMINATION").

1.2	Senzing App License.  If you have selected a "Senzing App License" pursuant to Subsection 1.1 
("Licensor Software Packages") above, then subject to all other terms of this Senzing EULA, 
Licensor hereby grants you a nonexclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to grant 
sublicenses) to use the Licensor Software solely as follows: (i) solely for the license period 
designated therein, subject to SECTION 5 ("TERMINATION"); (ii) solely for one (1) Concurrent 
User; (iii) solely for up to the number of DSRs designated therein; and (iv) solely for any internal 
productive use or externally-focused products and services. You understand and agree that this 
Senzing App License does not include any right to distribute Licensor Software, and that in all 
cases Licensor Software must be installed and used solely on hardware owned or controlled by 
you. You understand and agree that Senzing App Licenses may have automatic timers or "time 
bombs," and therefore may automatically cease to function after the end of the corresponding 
license period but paid for Senzing App Licenses shall be subject to at least a thirty (30) day 
"grace period" providing a margin beyond the permitted time period. You also understand and 
agree that Senzing App Licenses have DSR limiters but paid for Senzing App Licenses shall be 
subject to at least a ten percent (10%) "buffer" providing a margin over the permitted volume of 
DSRs.

1.3	Senzing API License.  If you have selected a "Senzing API License" pursuant to Subsection 1.1 
("Licensor Software Packages") above, then subject to all other terms of this Senzing EULA, 
including without limitation your obligation to make timely payment to Licensor, Licensor hereby 
grants you a nonexclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to grant sublicenses) to use 
the Licensor Software solely as follows:

A.	Senzing API Non-Production License. (i) solely for the license period designated therein, 
subject to SECTION 5 ("TERMINATION"); (ii) solely for up to the number of DSRs 
designated therein; and (iii) solely for non-productive use in order to integrate and test the 
Licensor Software for future productive use (e.g., in your production environment). You 
understand and agree that Senzing API Non-Production Licenses may have automatic 
timers or "time bombs," and therefore may automatically cease to function after the end of 
the corresponding license period but paid for Senzing API Non-Production Licenses shall 
be subject to at least a thirty (30) day "grace period" providing a margin beyond the 
permitted time period. You also understand and agree that Senzing API Non-Production 
Licenses have DSR limiters but paid for Senzing API Non-Production Licenses shall be 
subject to at least ten percent (10%) "buffer" providing a margin over the permitted 
volume of DSRs.

B.	Senzing API Production License. (i) solely for the license period designated therein, 
subject to SECTION 5 ("TERMINATION"); (ii) solely for up to the number of DSRs 
designated therein; (iii) for use in one (1) and only one (1) project whether this be an 
internal project (e.g., servicing your employees) or an externally-focused project (e.g., 
delivering a service to your customers); and (iv) for any internal productive use or 
externally-focused products and services, so long as the Licensor Software shall be 
combined with additional material functionality when provided to your customers (i.e., you 
shall not use the Licensor Software to provide data-matching, data quality, data wrangling 
or "Extract, Transform and Load" ("ETL") stand-alone products or services). You 
understand and agree that this Senzing API Production License does not include any 
right to distribute the Licensor Software, and that in all cases Licensor Software must be 
installed and used solely on hardware owned or controlled by you. You understand and 
agree that Senzing API Production Licenses may have automatic timers or "time bombs," 
and therefore may automatically cease to function after the end of the corresponding 
license period but shall be subject to at least a ninety (90) day "grace period" providing a 
margin beyond the permitted time period. You also understand and agree that Senzing 
API Production Licenses have DSR limiters but shall be subject to at least a ten percent 
(10%) "buffer" providing a margin over the permitted volume of DSRs. In addition, if you 
have selected a paid for annual Senzing API Production License, then each such License 
comes with three (3) years of "price protection," meaning that if Licensor increases its list 
price as reflected on Licensor's website, any such price increase will not affect you for 
three (3) years from the date upon which such list price was updated. You may copy, 
install, and use the Licensor Software at no additional charge for the following 
purposes:  for testing, developing, training, archiving, back-up, and for maintaining and 
performing disaster recovery testing and actual disaster recovery operation (including, 
loading of the Licensor Software on a hot back-up or disaster recovery site), regardless of 
the environment utilized.  Such uses shall not independently exceed the Senzing API 
Production License limitations.

1.4	License Rights and Restrictions. The license granted in this SECTION 1 ("GRANT OF 
LICENSE") is subject to the following: (a) you shall not allow any third party to access, use or 
copy the Licensor Software; (b) you shall not adapt, alter, modify, translate or create derivative 
works of the Licensor Software or documentation, or create any unauthorized copies thereof; (c) 
you shall not cause or permit use of the Licensor Software for unlawful purposes which would 
constitute a felony or crime or violate fundamental human rights guaranteed under the United 
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; (d) you shall not cause or permit reverse 
assembling, reverse compiling, translating or otherwise attempting to discover the Source Code 
from all or any portion of the Licensor Software, except as permitted by the national or regional 
law of the places where you do business (without the opportunity for contractual waiver), and then 
only with respect to the particular copy of Object Code incorporated into that Licensor Software; 
(e) you shall not copy any ideas, features, functions or  graphics of the Licensor Software; (f) you 
shall not delete, remove or modify any patent, copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights 
notices which appear on or in the Licensor Software or documentation; (g) you shall not assign, 
sublicense, distribute, lease, rent or otherwise transfer the Licensor Software in a manner 
inconsistent with the rights and restrictions set forth herein; and (h) third party software 
component limitations described in Section 1.9 ("THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE COMPONENT 
LIMITATIONS").

1.5	Delivery. Licensor shall deliver the Licensor Software to you via download. Licensor Software is 
deemed accepted by you upon delivery, but subject to the warranty provisions of this Senzing 
EULA.

1.6	Audits.  Unless you have entered into license terms permitting unlimited DSRs, then upon 
reasonable notice from Licensor during the Term and for six (6) months thereafter, you agree to 
permit Licensor or its representatives to audit and obtain copies of your written and electronic 
records regarding your use of the Licensor Software.  Any such audit will take place only during 
normal business hours.  In conducting such audit, Licensor and its representatives shall comply 
with your commercially reasonable internal security measures.  Where legal requirements do not 
allow such audit by Licensor or its representatives, however, you hereby agree to conduct such 
audit yourself in the form of a self-assessment under Licensor's direction (and to provide Licensor 
the foregoing copies).  Any such audits shall not be conducted more than on a quarterly basis.  
Where any such audit reveals any underpayment to Licensor, you shall pay such underpaid 
amount upon notice from Licensor.

1.7	Functionality. With respect to any use of the Licensor Software, you agree to independently 
confirm that the Licensor Software is suitable for use in your business and for your business 
purposes. You acquire no rights or licenses in the Licensor Software except those expressly 
granted herein. You hereby acknowledge that the Licensor Software is the confidential 
information of Licensor.

1.8	Third Party Software Sublicenses. The Licensor Software licensed to you may contain material 
provided by a third party ("Sublicensed Software" provided to Licensor by a "Provider of 
Sublicensed Software"). Accordingly, the parties agree that: (a) Licensor Software is licensed, not 
sold, and except for the license granted herein above, neither the Provider of Sublicensed 
Software nor Licensor passes any right, title or interest in or to the Sublicensed Software to you; 
(b) any warranties provided under this Senzing EULA are provided solely by Licensor and not by 
any Provider of Sublicensed Software; (c) the obligations described in SECTION 3 (INDEMNITY) 
and SECTION 4 (LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER) shall not apply to the Providers of 
Sublicensed Software; (d) the protections and limitations described in SECTION 4 (LIMITED 
WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER) and SECTION 6 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) apply to 
Providers of Sublicensed Software to the same extent such provisions apply to Licensor; and (e) 
each Provider of Sublicensed Software is an intended third-party beneficiary of the Senzing EULA 
and any rights of indemnification.

1.9	Third Party Software Component Limitations. Components of third party software as described 
in Appendix A ("Third Party Software Components") may not be: (a) used for any purpose other 
than to enable any application you create; (b) copied (except for backup purposes); (c) further 
distributed or transferred; or (d) reverse assembled, reverse compiled, or otherwise translated 
except as specifically permitted by law and without the possibility of contractual waiver.
2.	RESTRICTIONS ON BENCHMARKS. You may not use the Licensor Software without Senzing's prior 
written consent for publishing performance information or comparisons, except to the extent that such 
activity is specifically permitted by law.

3.	INDEMNITY.

3.1	Application. If you have selected a paid for License, the following applies to you:

A.	Licensor shall defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from and against any claims, 
damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out 
of any action by a third party that is based upon a claim that the Licensor Software as 
provided by Licensor directly infringes or otherwise directly violates the intellectual 
property rights of any person or entity.

B.	If your use of the Licensor Software is held to constitute direct infringement and is 
enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Licensor may at its option and expense: (i) 
procure for you the right to continue using the Licensor Software; or (ii) replace or modify 
the same with Software that is non-infringing and provides equivalent functionality 
acceptable to you.

C.	Licensor's obligation to indemnify you under this SECTION 3 ("INDEMNITY") shall not 
apply if the alleged infringement is based upon your unauthorized modification of the 
Licensor Software or the use of the Licensor Software in combination with other software 
or devices, where such combination caused the infringement and where infringement 
would not have occurred from your use of the Licensor Software alone.

3.2	Limitation. The foregoing states Licensor's sole liability and your sole remedy for any claim of 
intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or similar claims.

4.	LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.

4.1	Open Source Warranty. Licensor hereby warrants to you that the Licensor Software, as 
delivered by Licensor, does not contain any software licensed under an agreement that requires 
you to do any of the following as a condition of use of the Licensor Software itself or of other 
software incorporated into, derived from or distributed with the Licensor Software (each 
an "OSS Program"): (a) make available any Source Code, Object Code or design information 
regarding an OSS Program; (b) grant any permission to create modifications to or derivative 
works of an OSS Program; or (c) grant any royalty-free licenses under your intellectual property 
rights in and to an OSS Program. Licensor further represents and warrants that it will not, via an 
update or otherwise, incorporate any OSS Program into any version of the Licensor Software in a 
manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Senzing EULA.

4.2	Performance Warranty. Licensor hereby warrants to you that the Licensor Software will conform 
in ordinary use to Licensor's published specifications. In the event of a breach of the foregoing 
warranty, Licensor shall correct any corresponding defect in the Licensor Software and provide 
corrected Licensor Software to you promptly. If Licensor is unable to do so, you may terminate 
your license, and cease all use of the Licensor Software, and in such case Licensor shall refund 
to you upon your request any prepaid and unused fees under your corresponding license for such 
Licensor Software. The foregoing states Licensor's sole liability and your sole remedy for breach 
of this performance warranty or any defects in the Licensor Software.

4.3	Right to Grant License. Licensor hereby warrants to you that it has the right to grant the license 
under this Senzing EULA.

4.4	Disclaimer. OTHER THAN AS STATED IN THIS SECTION 4 ("LIMITED WARRANTY AND 
DISCLAIMER") AND AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY LAW, THE SOFTWARE AND ALL 
OTHER ITEMS AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTY. IN PARTICULAR, ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NONINFRINGEMENT ARE 
EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED. YOU SHALL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE OR PASS ON, AND 
SHALL TAKE ALL MEASURES NECESSARY TO ENSURE, THAT NEITHER YOU NOR ANY OF

GIVING RISE TO SUCH OBLIGATION. SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING, OTHER THAN FOR 
ANY EXCEEDING OF THE SCOPE OF THE LICENSE GRANTED HEREIN OR BREACH OF 
CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S TOTAL LIABILITY 
UNDER THIS SENZING EULA EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,000).
6.2	False Positives and False Negatives. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
